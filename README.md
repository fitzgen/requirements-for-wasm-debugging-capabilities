# WebAssembly Debugging Capabilities

Currently, this document only lists motivation and requirements. It attempts, as
much as possible, to avoid embedding assumptions about whether debugging
capabilities are provided by parsing a static format (a la
[DWARF](http://dwarfstd.org/)), via a programmatic interface (a la [language
servers](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol)), a combination
of those two, or by something else entirely. Rather than proposing a particular
solution, this is an attempt to enumerate the requirements and constraints that
*any* solution must satisfy.
